## General Information
Theis to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Task
The tasks involved in this project are as follows:
- The tasks involved in this project are as follows:
- Data Reading/Data Understanding
- Dataset Creation
- Dataset visualisation
- Model Building & training 
- Model Building & training on the augmented data
- Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
- Write your findings after the model fit, see if the issues are resolved or not?

## Technologies Used
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

The project utilizes data analysis and modeling libraries in Python, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, Scikit-learn for machine learning models, and Statsmodels for statistical analysis.
